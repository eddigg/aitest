### **Technical Memo to Junior Developer**

---

**Subject:** Updated Development Strategy and Task Delegation for Minimal Resource Software Development

**Objective:**
To extend the existing human-to-machine communication system on Replit, integrating a psychological decomposition pipeline (Perception → Appraisal → Reaction) while maintaining minimal resource usage, high performance, and alignment with evolving business logic. The system will leverage the existing Flask IntentParser, incorporate FastAPI for async endpoints, and ensure scalability, explainability, and maintainability within Replit’s free-tier constraints.

---

### **Task Delegation**

#### **1. FastAPI Integration and IntentParser Refactor**

**Objective:** Scaffold a FastAPI project and integrate the existing Flask IntentParser as a microservice or module.

**Tasks:**
- **Create a new Replit project with FastAPI:**
  - Initialize a new Replit project.
  - Install FastAPI and Uvicorn: `pip install fastapi uvicorn`.

- **Refactor the Flask IntentParser:**
  - Convert the existing Flask IntentParser (`/parse`, `/health` endpoints) into a Python package or expose it via HTTP for FastAPI to call.
  - Ensure Pydantic models are reused for consistency.

- **Implement a FastAPI `/parse` endpoint:**
  - Wrap the IntentParser in a FastAPI endpoint, maintaining a stateless design.

- **Test end-to-end flow:**
  - Ensure user input is processed by the IntentParser and returns structured JSON output (e.g., `{ "action": "schedule", "time": "15:00" }`).

**Deliverables:**
- FastAPI Repl with integrated IntentParser.
- Unit tests for `/parse` endpoint (95% coverage, 3 intents tested).
- README documenting setup and API spec.

**Deadline:** Day 2.

#### **2. PerceptionEncoder Implementation**

**Objective:** Build a PerceptionEncoder to generate environment embeddings from text inputs.

**Tasks:**
- **Implement a lightweight encoder using PyTorch:**
  - Use a pre-trained model (e.g., `distilbert-base-uncased`).

- **Convert the model to ONNX with 8-bit quantization:**
  - Use `optimum.onnxruntime` to convert and quantize the model for a <100MB footprint.

- **Create a FastAPI `/perception` endpoint:**
  - Accept text inputs and return embeddings (shape: `[batch, 768]`).

- **Test with sample inputs:**
  - Ensure consistent embedding vectors for similar inputs (e.g., “Schedule a meeting”).

**Deliverables:**
- ONNX-based PerceptionEncoder integrated into FastAPI.
- Unit tests for embedding consistency (cosine similarity >0.9 for similar inputs).
- Benchmark report (latency <100ms, memory <150MB).

**Deadline:** Day 4.

#### **3. AppraisalNetwork and ReactionDecoder Development**

**Objective:** Implement AppraisalNetwork and ReactionDecoder to map embeddings to business-specific actions.

**Tasks:**
- **Develop a PyTorch-based AppraisalNetwork:**
  - Map embeddings to latent appraisal vectors (e.g., `[priority, urgency, context]`).

- **Implement a ReactionDecoder:**
  - Convert appraisal vectors into structured actions (JSON) and human-readable text.

- **Integrate SymbolicAI for business rule checks:**
  - Enforce rules between Appraisal and Reaction stages (e.g., `IF priority == high THEN notify_manager`).

- **Create FastAPI `/appraisal` and `/reaction` endpoints:**
  - Ensure the pipeline flow: `/parse → /perception → /appraisal → /reaction`.

- **Test end-to-end flow for 3 intents:**
  - Cover intents like scheduling, notification, and query.

**Deliverables:**
- AppraisalNetwork and ReactionDecoder modules in the FastAPI app.
- SymbolicAI rule set for 3 business constraints.
- Unit tests covering end-to-end pipeline (90% success rate on 10 test cases).

**Deadline:** Day 5.

---

#### **4. XAI and HITL Enhancements**

**Objective:** Extend explainability and human oversight for the new pipeline.

**Tasks:**
- **Add SHAP explainers to the AppraisalNetwork:**
  - Attribute contributions of embedding features to appraisal vectors.

- **Use LIME for local explanations of ReactionDecoder outputs:**
  - Generate explanations when confidence <0.9.

- **Extend the existing Flask HITL endpoint:**
  - Handle appraisal and reaction reviews, flagging low-confidence outputs.

- **Log explanations and HITL interactions to SQLite:**
  - Use a schema: `(timestamp, input, appraisal, reaction, explanation, confidence, reviewed)`.

**Deliverables:**
- SHAP/LIME explainers integrated into `/appraisal` and `/reaction` endpoints.
- Updated HITL endpoint with appraisal/reaction support.
- SQLite logging schema and sample logs.

**Deadline:** Day 6.

#### **5. Business Rule Enforcement and Policy Module**

**Objective:** Enforce business constraints via a policy module.

**Tasks:**
- **Define 3–5 business rules:**
  - Examples: “Reject actions exceeding budget $100”, “Ensure SLA <2h for high-priority tasks”.

- **Implement a SymbolicAI policy module:**
  - Check appraisal vectors against rules before ReactionDecoder execution.

- **Add a FastAPI `/policy` endpoint:**
  - Log rule violations and return error responses.

- **Test policy enforcement:**
  - Ensure 100% rule adherence for 5 test cases.

**Deliverables:**
- Policy module with 3–5 rules.
- `/policy` endpoint with logging.
- Unit tests for rule enforcement.

**Deadline:** Day 7.

---

#### **6. Monitoring, Logging, and CI/CD Setup**

**Objective:** Ensure operational reliability and deployment automation.

**Tasks:**
- **Configure UptimeRobot:**
  - Monitor for 99.9% uptime and set alerts for latency, CPU/RAM usage.

- **Implement structured logging with structlog:**
  - Log to Supabase or a local file (`logs/app.log`).

- **Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD:**
  - Run unit tests, linting (PEP 8), and deploy to Replit/Render on push to main.

- **Test CI/CD pipeline:**
  - Use a dummy commit to validate the setup.

**Deliverables:**
- UptimeRobot configuration file.
- Structured logging setup with sample logs.
- GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`).
- Deployment confirmation on Replit.

**Deadline:** Day 7.

### **Management Plan**

- **Daily Standups:** 10-minute sync to track progress and resolve blockers.
- **Code Reviews:** Use Replit’s collaboration tools for peer reviews. Enforce modular design, PEP 8, and 80% test coverage.
- **Risk Mitigation:**
  - **Resource Limits:** Monitor RAM/CPU daily. Use `tinybert` if memory exceeds 400MB.
  - **Dependency Conflicts:** Pin versions (e.g., `fastapi==0.103.0`, `onnxruntime==1.16.0`).
  - **Pipeline Failures:** Implement fallback logic (e.g., default to IntentParser if Appraisal fails).

---

### **Communication Protocol**

- Use precise, technical language in all updates.
- Share deliverables via Replit links with READMEs and test results.
- Update progress in Notion daily, with detailed error logs for blockers.
- Escalate issues via Slack with stack traces or performance metrics.

---

### **Next Steps**

- Start FastAPI scaffold and IntentParser integration by EOD today.
- Schedule a review of the PerceptionEncoder stub by day 3.
- Provide a sample FastAPI + ONNX integration script if needed.
